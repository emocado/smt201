```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image100.png")
```

Click on the OK button to run the function.
Notice that a new field called POI_CODE has been added into the attribute table of roads GIS layer. Also note that all the records are indicated with POI_CODE values equals to 1.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image8.png")
```

You are now ready to rasterize the roads layer.
Save the editing before moving on.

For Pixel size X and Pixel size Y, change to 50.
Keep the rest of the settings as default.
Click on the Run button.

## 3.6 Education Choropleth Map
From the menu bar, navigate to Vector -> Analysis Tool -> Count Points in Polygon. 
For Input Polygon layer, select study_area.
For Input Points layer, select schools
Run the window.
A temporary layer Count would be created. Saved the temporary layer into geopackage as school_count.
Right click on school_count
Click Properties
Click Symbology from the left
Select Graduated from the drop down
For Value, select NUMPOINTS from the drop down
Set Color Ramp as Blues
Set mode as Natural Breaks (Jenks). This is to ensure that the values in each bin do not vary too much.
Click on Classify
Click on Apply
Click on OK

# 4.0 Site Suitability
Download the AHP Template. Open the Excel template and perform AHP analysis.
This is our AHP score that we come up with.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image51.png")
```

This is our AHP score.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image32.png")
```

From the above results, health risk factor poses the most critical factor and economic factor being the least weighted factor in determining the suitable site.
The consistency check of 4% is below 10% and the inconsistency is acceptable.

## 4. 1 Prepare a composite accessibility layer
From the menu bar, navigate to Processing -> Toolbox. Search for raster calculator and double click the raster calculator under raster analysis
Copy and paste the code below into the Expression box.
"(1-("Slope@1"/70.30928))*0.033+(1-("prox_transport@1"-562.249939)/(100132.03125-562.249939))*0.053+("prox_hotspot@1"/88631.007812)*0.166+("forest_prox@1"/86003.609375)*0.23+(1-("raster_road_prox@1"/86038.75))*0.086+("waterbody_prox@1"/87802.921875)*0.432" 
 
Noticed that we used 1 - z-score of slope, transport and road as we want higher z-score to represent better site suitability.
 
For referenced layer use prox_building.
Click run.
Save the composite layer into geopackage as composite_layer

## 4.2 Identify suitable sites
We now need to identify a suitable area based on the composite accessibility layer that we have obtained. The scale of the composite accessibility layer ranges from 0.155585 to 0.690181. After investigating the various values to determine the best value to identify the composite factor score, we have decided on 0.3 to better pinpoint the ideal location.
 
In order to derive the site suitability layer, the reclassifying operation of raster GIS will be used. In QGIS, raster reclassifying can be performed by using the Reclassify by Table function.
From the Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by Table, double-click on it.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image104.png")
```

The dialog window of Reclassify by Table appears.
For Raster Layer, select composite_layer from the drop-down list.
For the Reclassification table, click on the icon.
The dialog window of the Fixed table appears.
Enter the value similar to the screenshot below.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image31.png")
```

Click on Add Row button when you want to add a new row.
Click on OK button when you have completed the entry.
For Range boundaries, select min <= value < max.
For Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.
Lastly, click on Run button to run the process.
The temporary layer should look like this.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image46.png")
```

Clip the temporary layer into the study area.
The study area should be a dissolved polygon. Open the Dissolve window by clicking Vector -> Geoprocessing -> Dissolve.
In the Dissolve window, select study_area.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image12.png")
```

Run the window.
Save the temporary layer as study_area_dissolved.
Open the Clip Raster by masked extent window by Raster -> Extraction -> Clip Raster by Masked Extent.
Select the temporary layer as in Input layer.
Select study_area_dissolved as the masked layer.
Select EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 as the Source CRS and Target CRS.
Run the window.
The temporary layer should look like the following

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image47.png")
```

Save the temporary layer into geopackage as suitability

## 4.3 Vectorise suitable sites
Next, we will convert the suitable site identified above from raster into vector through vectorisation.
From the menu bar, select Raster -> Conversion -> Polygonize(Raster to Vector)
The Polygonize (Raster to Vector) dialog window appears.
For Input Layer, select suitability from the drop-down list.
For Name of the field to create, type Sites.
Keep the checkbox in front of Use 8-connectedness uncheck.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image24.png")
```

When you are ready, click on the Run button.
When the computation is completed, a new temporary layer called Vectorized will be added on the Layers panel and display on the view window.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image59.png")
```

We would only like to save the areas which are suitable (which we previously labelled as ‘1’). 
Use the Select by expression tool 
Enter the following expression in the expression box - "Sites" = 1
Save the selected area into geopackage as suitability_vector.
Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/images/image55.png")
```
