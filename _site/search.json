The scale of the composite accessibility layer ranges from 0.155585 to 0.690181. After investigating the various values to determine the best value to identify the composite factor score, we have decided on 0.3 to better pinpoint the ideal location.\r\nIn order to derive the site suitability layer, the reclassifying operation of raster GIS will be used. In QGIS, raster reclassifying can be performed by using the Reclassify by Table function.\r\nFrom the Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by Table, double-click on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dialog window of Reclassify by Table appears. - For Raster Layer, select composite_layer from the drop-down list. - For the Reclassification table, click on the icon.\r\nThe dialog window of the Fixed table appears. - Enter the value similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on Add Row button when you want to add a new row.\r\nClick on OK button when you have completed the entry.\r\nFor Range boundaries, select min <= value < max.\r\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\r\nLastly, click on Run button to run the process.\r\nThe temporary layer should look like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClip the temporary layer into the study area. - The study area should be a dissolved polygon. Open the Dissolve window by clicking Vector -> Geoprocessing -> Dissolve. - In the Dissolve window, select study_area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRun the window.\r\nSave the temporary layer as study_area_dissolved.\r\nOpen the Clip Raster by masked extent window by Raster -> Extraction -> Clip Raster by Masked Extent.\r\nSelect the temporary layer as in Input layer.\r\nSelect study_area_dissolved as the masked layer.\r\nSelect EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 as the Source CRS and Target CRS.\r\nRun the window.\r\nThe temporary layer should look like the following\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSave the temporary layer into geopackage as suitability\r\n4.3 Vectorise suitable sites\r\nNext, we will convert the suitable site identified above from raster into vector through vectorisation. - From the menu bar, select Raster -> Conversion -> Polygonize(Raster to Vector)\r\nThe Polygonize (Raster to Vector) dialog window appears. - For Input Layer, select suitability from the drop-down list. - For Name of the field to create, type Sites. - Keep the checkbox in front of Use 8-connectedness uncheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready, click on the Run button. When the computation is completed, a new temporary layer called Vectorized will be added on the Layers panel and display on the view window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would only like to save the areas which are suitable (which we previously labelled as ‘1’). - Use the Select by expression tool - Enter the following expression in the expression box - “Sites” = 1 - Save the selected area into geopackage as suitability_vector. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From the working population map, we can see that there are 2 highly populated areas, one in Samarinda, and one in Balikpapan, with populations ranging from 13529 to 45505. The settlement heatmap also tells us the same thing.\r\nThe capital should not be too close to the major settlements to avoid the disruption of too many local lives. However, it should not be too far from the major settlements as well to allow the new capital access to resources of an already established city, such as clean water, electricity, and human capital.\r\n1.2 Demographics\r\n1.2.1 Religion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese maps show the distributions of the most common religions across our study area. The two most common religions are islam and christianity. From the maps, we can see that Muslims are more common in Indonesia. For areas that are not largely dominated by Muslims, there are often many Christians.\r\nUnderstanding the religious landscape of the new capital is important. Since these are the most common religions, corresponding religious buildings should be built in the capital to ensure that the majority of the population can easily practice their religions.\r\n1.2.2 Gender\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the proportion of men in each area across the study area. From the map, we can see that most areas generally have an even mix of males and females. However, some areas still have a relatively larger proportion of men.\r\nIt is important to ensure that there is a relatively even mix of genders. Men are usually more suited for physical labour, which would be important in building up a new capital. It is also important to ensure that there is a good mix of men and women as well distributed areas tend to be more developed.\r\n2.0 Economic and Businesses\r\n2.1 Agriculture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the distribution of agricultural land used (plantation, farming and rice field). The land is widely spread across the study area. A significant portion of Penajam and Balikpapan is used for agriculture.\r\nThe consideration behind utilising areas of existing agricultural land may be crucial as using such land can displace farmers and citizens making a livelihood with these land. Additionally, this might impact the economy on a larger scale depending on the type of agricultural product they are producing as this lowers the stock of the agricultural product.\r\n2.2 Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the distribution of existing schools within the study area. Many of these schools are concentrated in Kota Samarinda with some in Penajam.\r\nAlthough schools can be built while building the new capital, it would be good to identify the existing infrastructure available for schools and leverage on such resources or even utilising existing education resources such as facilities and manpower (teaching staff). The availability of schools is also a sign that the population in the area are educated.\r\n3.0 Transport and Communication\r\n3.1 Airport and Seaport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the distribution of airports and seaports (airports and marina/ ferry terminal) in our study area. Seaports and airports are important modes of transportation into and out of the country. It is crucial for the new capital to be accessible to these transportation as large amounts of materials need to be transported to build the new capital.\r\nNot to mention, it would help to facilitate a booming business environment in the new capital as imports and exports become more accessible. It also allows more tourists to visit the capital, be it for business or leisure reasons.\r\n3.2 Road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the distribution of roads (pedestrian and vehicle) in our study area. From the map, we can see that the 4 major city/town (Balikpapan, Penajam, Samarinda and Tennggarong) have very good accessibility to roads. Currently, the capital’s perennial traffic jams have been cited by Jokowi’s administration as one of the main reasons behind the decision to relocate the country’s administrative hub from Jakarta. Annual economic loss due to traffic congestion in Jakarta at 100 trillion rupiah (US$7.04 billion). Hence, it is crucial that there is sufficient and accessible road infrastructure for the new capital.\r\n4.0 Infrastructure\r\n4.1 Water bodies and Waterways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the major waterways (rivers or canals) as well as the water body (rivers). Most of them flow through Kutai Kartenegara and Kota Samarinda with some smaller ones flowing in Penajam. These waterways can be helpful where there is ample flow of water to the sea which can prevent the area from overflooding which is what is happening in Jakarta. However, excessive amounts without a proper channel of flow can cause flooding.\r\n4.2 Buildings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the proximity of buildings in our study area. The selected site should be away from population (i.e. housing areas and buildings) as sufficient space is needed to make way for the new capital. Furthermore, it is to avoid disease spreading to the nearby population given that we are in the midst of a pandemic\r\n5.0 Environment and Hazard\r\n5.1 Forest Fire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the concentration of forest fire hotspots in our study area. Forest fire, typically from slash and burn techniques from local agriculture, can cause excessive haze which is detrimental to health.\r\nA high density of forest fires can be found in Northern Kutai Kartanegara with some in Samarida and Penamjan.\r\n5.2 Forest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map shows the distribution of forests (primary and secondary rainforest, primary and secondary mangrove forest and plantation forest) in the study area. Most of the forest is located in the southern and northern regions of Penajam as well as the northern region of Kutai Kartanegara. There are also some mangrove forests in particular in the western region of Kutai Kartanegara.\r\nAs most of these forests are primary and secondary forests, it would be wise to avoid these regions as these forests contain a wide variety of biodiversity and deforestation can have many adverse impacts including soil erosion, flooding and increased greenhouse gases.\r\n5.3 Slope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClick here for terrain map\r\nThis map shows that there is a concentration of mountainous areas in the south-west part of our study area, around Penajam Paser Utara. The selected site should avoid steep slopes. This is because construction at steep slopes tends to involve a lot of cut-and-fill and will lend to relatively higher development cost. Furthermore, landslides are one of the common natural disasters in Indonesia. Hence, the selected site for the new capital should avoid areas prone to landslides, which are near mountainous areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We decided not to incorporate the last factor, proximity to urban settlements, as we found it hard to computate a suitable range that would be not too far nor too close to urban settlements. We thus created a settlement heatmap to identify the most suitable site while comparing it with the suitability layer based on the AHP score. After experimenting with different minimum composite scores, we decided to use 0.3. This is because using composite score > 0.3 gives us a result without too many or excessively large areas. With a composite score smaller than 0.3, we found that the areas we got were too small and would not fit in the 4500 - 5500 hectare range. Similarly, using a composite score above 0.3 resulted in extremely large areas that would span across half the study space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
