# 1.0 Motivation of the project

Indonesia has planned to relocate their capital from Jakarta to  Kalimantan on the island of Borneo in response to the considerable sociological issues, pollution, traffic, climate change risks, and political influences.

This move is estimated to cost nearly $33 billion (US), thus it is imperative to evaluate the site for relocation is suitable and sustainable.

The project aims to analyse **Kutai Kartanegara Regency** and **Penajam North Paser Regency** in East Kalimantan in terms of the following:

- Population and demographic
- Economic and Businesses
- Transport and Communication
- Infrastructure
- Environment and Hazard

## objective 2

## study Area
- **All sub-districts** and **district** of **Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda**.

- selected districts and sub-districts of **North Penajam Paser**:
  - Babulu
  - Penajam
  - Sepaku and Waru
